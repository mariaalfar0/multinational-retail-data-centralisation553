### Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

This project centralises the sales data from a multinational company so that it's 
accessed from one centralised location and acts as a single source of truth for 
sales data.

In this project, I have consolidated my knowledge of: 
- Different data types (PDF, RDS, AWS, CSV, .JSON)
- Data extraction and cleaning methods
- Uploading data to a database
- Querying data using SQL
